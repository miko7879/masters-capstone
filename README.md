# masters-capstone
This repository contains all code and documentation pertinent to the capstone project I did as part of my Master's at RIT. The code contained here is 
just a copy of the examm-fala branch (which I was responsible for) of Travis Desell's exact repo: https://github.com/travisdesell/exact

Please visit that repository for the latest version of EXACT and any other information related to the overall workings of this algorithm.
